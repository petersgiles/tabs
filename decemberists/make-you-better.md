[Intro]

Bm* D* G* (x2) (some sliding included)


[Verse 1]

Bm*         D*
I want you, thin fingers
G*
I wanted you, thin fingernails
Bm*          D*
And when you bend backwards
G*                          Bm*
I wanted you, I needed you, ohh
D*         G*
To make me better

Bm*           D*
I'll love you in springtime
G*
I lost you when summer came
Bm*          D*
And when you pulled backwards
G*                          Bm*
I wanted to, I needed to, ohh
D*         G*
To make me better
Bm*  D*         G*
Ohh, to make me better


[Chorus]

A                      G     D
But we're not so starry-eyed anymore
G                         D                A      G 
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
A                          G              D
And won't it all just come around to make you
G                       D              A
Let it all un-break you to the day you met her
         G
But it'd make you better
              Bm*    D*  G*
It'd make you better


[Verse 2]

Bm*        D*
I sung you your twinges
G*
I suffered you your tattle-tales
Bm*           D*
And when you broke sideways
G*                          Bm*
I wanted you, I needed you, ohh
D*         G*
To make me better
Bm*  D*         G*
Ohh, to make me better


[Chorus 2]

A                      G     D
But we're not so starry-eyed anymore
G                         D                A      G 
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
A                          G              D
And won't it all just come around to make you
G                       D              A
Let it all un-break you to the day that you met her
             G    
And it'd make you better
              Bm        G   D  A  (2x)
Did it make you better


[Bridge]

Bm                     G                  D      A
And all I wanted was a sliver to call mine
Bm                     G                    D
And all I wanted was a shimmer of your shine
A
To make me bright


[Chorus]

A                      G     D
Cause we're not so starry-eyed anymore
G                         D                A      G 
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
A                          G              D
And won't it all just come around to make you
G                       D              A
Let it all un-break you to the day you met her
             G    
But it'd make you better
              Bm*    D*  G*
It'd make you betterï»¿
