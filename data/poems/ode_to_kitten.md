# Ode to my Kitten

A Sonnet by Pete
My warmest kitten, you inspire me to write.
How I love the way you squeak, laugh and giggle,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Dreams and images of your derri√®re's wiggle.

Let my mind drift to soft winters nights
Where warmth lingers on exoctic tangled notes.
Rains fall and winds blow their frozen blights,
Safe we lay together, entranced as love dotes.

How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
I love your excited breath, mouth and eyes.
Thinking of your round curves fills my days.
As I wish my hand lingered on your thighs.

Most of all your wit and charm has my heart,
Remember me my beautiful kitten when we're apart.
