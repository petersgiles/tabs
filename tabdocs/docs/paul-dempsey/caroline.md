INTRO:
C--Em

VERSE 1:
       C
Well I hear you're driving someone elses car now
    Em
She said you came and took your stuff away
        C
All the poetry in the trunk you kept your life in
  Em
I knew that it would come to that some day

PRE-CHORUS 1:
       C
Like a sad hallucination 

When I opened my eyes
    Em
The train had passed the station

And you were trapped inside
      C
And I never wondered where you went
                              D
I only wondered why, I wonder why

CHORUS
C--Em
Oh, Caroline (4x)

VERSE 2:
       C
Well I hear you're using someone elses number
    Em
She said she saw you in the store today
           C
It doesn't matter who's address you're listed under
  Em
I only know they'll never make you stay

PRE-CHORUS 2:
       C
Like a memory in motion

You were only passing through
        Em
That is all you'll ever know of life

That is all you'll ever do
          C
There's a dream I have where I sail away

Looking back I wave at you
               D
And I wave goodbye

CHORUS:
C--Em
Oh, Caroline(4X)

AD-LIB:
G--C(2X)

PRE-CHORUS 3:
    C
In another life I see you

As an angel flying high
        Em
And the hands of time will free you

You will cast the chains aside
      C
Every dog will come and kiss away
                                           D(stop)
Every tear that's ever fallin' from those eyes
D
Behind those eyes I wonder

CODA:
C--Em

Oh, Caroline
Someitmes I wonder
