## Intro  
  
Bm* D* G* (x2) (some sliding included)  
  
## Verse 1
  
Bm*         D*  
I want you, thin fingers  
G*  
I wanted you, thin fingernails  
Bm*          D*  
And when you bend backwards  
G*                          Bm*  
I wanted you, I needed you, ohh  
D*         G*  
To make me better  
  
Bm*           D*  
I'll love you in springtime  
G*  
I lost you when summer came  
Bm*          D*  
And when you pulled backwards  
G*                          Bm*  
I wanted to, I needed to, ohh  
D*         G*  
To make me better  
Bm*  D*         G*  
Ohh, to make me better  
  
## Chorus  
  
A                      G     D  
But we're not so starry-eyed anymore  
G                         D                A      G  
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters  
A                          G              D  
And won't it all just come around to make you  
G                       D              A  
Let it all un-break you to the day you met her  
         G  
But it'd make you better  
              Bm*    D*  G*  
It'd make you better  
  
## Verse 2
  
Bm*        D*  
I sung you your twinges  
G*  
I suffered you your tattle-tales  
Bm*           D*  
And when you broke sideways  
G*                          Bm*  
I wanted you, I needed you, ohh  
D*         G*  
To make me better  
Bm*  D*         G*  
Ohh, to make me better  
  
## Chorus 2
  
A                      G     D  
But we're not so starry-eyed anymore  
G                         D                A      G  
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters  
A                          G              D  
And won't it all just come around to make you  
G                       D              A  
Let it all un-break you to the day that you met her  
             G  
And it'd make you better  
              Bm        G   D  A  (2x)  
Did it make you better  
  
## Bridge
  
Bm                     G                  D      A  
And all I wanted was a sliver to call mine  
Bm                     G                    D  
And all I wanted was a shimmer of your shine  
A  
To make me bright  
  
## Chorus
  
A                      G     D  
Cause we're not so starry-eyed anymore  
G                         D                A      G  
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters  
A                          G              D  
And won't it all just come around to make you  
G                       D              A  
Let it all un-break you to the day you met her  
             G  
But it'd make you better  
              Bm*    D*  G*  
It'd make you better
