Am                    Asus4              Fmaj7      G
  Sometimes when this place gets kind of empty
Am                   Asus4                 Fmaj7      G
  The sound of their breath fades with the light
Am         Asus4    Fmaj7         G
  I think about the loveless facination
Am            Asus4       Fmaj7      G
    Under the Milky Way tonight
