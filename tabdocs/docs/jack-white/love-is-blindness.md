[Chorus]

Am  
Love is blindness,    
           Gmaj  
I don't want to see    
                F                      Dsus2  
Won't you wrap the night around me?    
Am        E  
Oh, my heart,    
           Am  
Love is blindness.    

  
[Verse 1]    

Am  
I'm in a parked car,    
         Gmaj  
On a crowded street     
         F  
And I see my love     
  Dsus2  
Made complete.    
                    Am  
The thread is ripping,   
                 E  
the knot is slipping   
            Am  
Love is blindness. 


[Verse 2]  
 
Am  
Love is clockworks    
          Gmaj  
and is cold steel   
F              Dsus2  
Fingers too numb to feel.    
                 Am  
Squeeze the handle,    
                  E  
blow out the candle   
 Am  
Blindness (blindness) 


[Chorus]

Am
Love is blindness,  
           Gmaj
I don't want to see   
                F                      Dsus2
Won't you wrap the night around me? 
Am        E
Oh, my love,
Am
Blindness. 


[Verse 3]

A#m/F
A little death  
             Am
without mourning 
      E
No call,  
      Am
no warning 
A#m/F                    Am
Baby, A dangerous idea  
        E
That almost makes sense.  


[Solo]


[Verse 4]

            Am
Love is drowning  
       Gmaj
in a deep well  
           F
All the secrets,  
             Dsus2
and nobody else to tell. 
              Am
Take the money,   
                E
why don't honey? 
Am
Blindness. 


[Chorus/Outro]

Am
Love is blindness,  
          Gmaj
I'm so sick, I don't want to see
 F                                Dsus2
Won't you just take the night, 

wrap it all around me?
Am        E
Oh, my love,   
Am
Blindness. 

Am                          Gmaj
Love is blindness    mmmmmhhh
F            Dsus2
I'm too numb to feel  
Am               E
Blow out the candles  
Am
Blindness
