This is not totally accurate, mainly because It's pretty hard to
transcribe Piano. It sounds Ok.

Lyrics:

Intro

Verse1:
  C#m (x13321@4)            B (x2444x@1)          Ab (xx1114@1)              A (x02220@1)    
  I'll warn you, if cornered, I'll scratch my way out of the pen
  C#m (x13321@4)    B (x2444x@1)     Ab (xx1114@1)              A (x02220@1)    
  Wired, an animal. The claustrophobia begins
  C#m
     You think I'm scared of girls, Well maybe
     But I'm not afraid of you
     You want to scare me then you'll cling to me no matter what I do
Verse2:
  C#m (x13321@4)      B (x2444x@1)       Ab (xx1114@1)            A (x02220@1)    
  Tell you a secret  They shared a needle once or twice
  C#m (x13321@4)          B (x2444x@1)          Ab (xx1114@1)          A (x02220@1)    
  I loved her, she loved me  We slept together a couple of times
  C#m
     You think I'm proud of this, Well maybe
     But the shame you never lose
     Infatuated with a lunatic and cornered by the muse
Chorus1:
 B (x2444x@1)                      C#m (x13321@4)                E (022100@1)  
 And it goes           down every           niiiiiight
   This must be         what jail is really   liiiiiike
   And I will scratch my way out of this      peeeeeen,   again

Verse part1

Verse3:
  C#m (x13321@4)            B (x2444x@1)          Ab (xx1114@1)         A (x02220@1)    
  Lonely?        Maybe          Or maybe not, It all depends
  C#m (x13321@4)         B (x2444x@1)          Ab (xx1114@1)         A (x02220@1)    
  Your ideal, your image     Your definition of a friend
  C#m
     If what you're shoveling is company
     Then I'd rather be alone
     Resentment always goes much further than it was supposed to go

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Verse1 until "an animal".
end on C#m
