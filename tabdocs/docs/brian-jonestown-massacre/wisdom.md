## Lyrics  
F# C#  
if i thought i knew the reason  
E  
why i've gone and fallen  
B A  
in love with you  
F# C#  
you're the one thing i believe in  
E  
and i know quite well  
B A  
what i've got to do  

---

first you say it's ok  
then you say there's no way  
then i'm making love to you!  
you're the one thing i believe in  
and know it's time cause i've  
got to tell you  

---

my love is like a flower  
daisies are always free.  
pulling out the petals i wonder, if you love me?  
love. love me, love me!  

---

if i thought i knew the reason  
why i've gone and fallen  
in love with you  

---

you're the one thing i believe in  
and i know it's time because i've  
got to tell you  

---

first you say it's ok  
then you say there's no way  
then i'm making love to you!  
you're the one thing i believe in  
and i'll get my way  
or i'm going to kill you
