## Lyrics

F#C#

if i thought i knew the reason 

E

why i've gone and fallen 

B A

in love with you 

you're the one thing i believe in 

and i know quite well

what i've got to do 


first you say it's ok 

then you say there's no way 

then i'm making love to you! 

you're the one thing i believe in 

and know it's time cause i've 

got to tell you 


my love is like a flower

daisies are always free. 

pulling out the petals i wonder, if you love me? 

love. love me, love me! 


if i thought i knew the reason 

why i've gone and fallen 

in love with you 


you're the one thing i believe in 

and i know it's time because i've 

got to tell you 


first you say it's ok 

then you say there's no way 

then i'm making love to you! 

you're the one thing i believe in 

and i'll get my way 

or i'm going to kill you


(Fade)
