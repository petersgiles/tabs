F#C#
if i thought i knew the reason 
E
why i've gone and fallen 
B A
in love with you 

you're the one thing i believe in 
and i know quite well
what i've got to do 

first you say it's ok 
then you say there's no way 
then i'm making love to you! 
you're the one thing i believe in 
and know it's time cause i've 
got to tell you 

my love 
is 
like a flower 
daisies 
are 
always free. 
pulling out 
the petals 
i 
wonder, 
if you 
love me? 
love. 
love me, 
love me! 

if i thought i knew the reason 
why i've gone and fallen 
in love with you 

you're the one thing i believe in 
and i know it's time because i've 
got to tell you 

first you say it's ok 
then you say there's no way 
then i'm making love to you! 
you're the one thing i believe in 
and 
i'll get my way 
or 
i'm going to kill you
