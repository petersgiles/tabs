## Lyrics

D       G                              D       G  
i try to see well i guess that i'm blind  
D               G                        D         G  
it's fine with me cause i'm going to keep trying  
D                 G                         D      G  
and i've made disapointment my very best friend  
D             G                      D          G  
i wait and see who your going to be and when  

D                 C  
we don't want you be yourself  
    G  
you see  
                 D  
we want you to free yourself  
   D                  C                  G  
it does no good to pretend that you are free  
             D  
i can not see you  
                   C  
i love you but it drags me down  


D                   G  
cause i know it so well  
D                     G  
   how i never could tell  
                     D       G  
who's my very best friend?  
                   D       G  
how i know you so well  
                     D       G  
who's my very best friend?  
                   D       G  
how i know you so well  

i could make you be me.  

   D            G        A           G  G  A  G

     D           G           A               G  D   G A G  
you know i will get what i want, while im getting whats mine  
   D           G      A           G G  A  G  
i see you know no shame you wont give me the chance  
   D           G               A             G  D     G  
im begging your momma and your daddy just to give me the chance  
A    G  
im getting nothing
