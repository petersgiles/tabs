Am (x2)              C                  F (x2)

Gold teeth and a curse for this town

         C                G (x2)

were all in my mouth.

        C                       F (x2)
Only, I don't know how

             Am    G
they got out, dear.

  Am (x2)        C          F (x2)

Turn me back into the pet that

    C                   G (x2)

I was when we met.

           C          F                 Am   G (x4)
I was happier then with no mind-set.

Chorus:

                    G (x2)  C (x2)              
And if you'd took to me like a
F      C                 G (x2)

Gull takes to the wind. 
                  G (x2)          C (x2)         

Well, I'd 'a jumped from my tree

       F       C                    F              C
And I'd a danced like the king of the eyesores

             F              C                   G (x4)
And the rest of our lives would 'a fared well.

 

Am (x2)                   C                 F (x2)
New slang when you notice the stripes,

        C                G (x2)

the dirt in your fries.

              C                       F (x2)
Hope it's right when you die,

              Am    G

old and bony.

 

Am (x2)                C                         F (x2)
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall,

     C                      G (x2)
Never should have called

            C                   F                 Am   G (x4)
But my head's to the wall and I'm lonely. 

Chorus

 

Solo


Am (x2)               C             F (x2)
God speed all the bakers at dawn

              C                G (x2)

may they all cut their thumbs,

                C             F                    Am   G (x4)
And bleed into their buns 'till they melt away. 

Chorus 2:

                  G (x2)     C (x2)              
I'm looking in on the good life I might

F                   C            G (x2)

be doomed never to find.

                 G (x2)             C (x2)              
Without a trust or flaming fields am I

F      C            G (x2)

too dumb to refine?

                    G (x2)  C (x2)              
And if you'd took to me like 
         F       C                    F                C

Well I'd a danced like the queen of the eyesores

              F              C                   G (x4)
And the rest of our lives would 'a fared well.
