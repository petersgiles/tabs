Em  
Brother, my cup is empty  
And I haven't got a penny  
      Am  
For to buy no more whiskey  
Em  
I have to go home            (2 times)  
  
Em  
I am the captain of my pain  
Tis the bit, the bridle,  
And the trashing cane  
   Am  
The stirrup, the harness  
And the whipping mane  
   Em  
The pickled eye  
And the shrinking brain  
O brother, buy me one more drink  
I'll explain the nature of my pain  
    Am  
Yeah let me tell you once again  
    Em  
I am the captain of my pain  
  
O brother, my cup is empty.........  
  
I cannot blame it all on her  
To blame her all would be a lie  
For many a night I lay awake  
And wished that I could watch her die  
To see her accusing finger spurt  
To see flies swarm her hateful eye  
To watch her groaning in the dirt  
To see her clicking tongue crack dry  
O brother, buy me one more drink  
One more drink and then goodbye  
And do not mock me when I say  
Let's drink one more before I die  
  
O brother, my cup is empty.........  
  
I've been sliding down on rainbows  
I've been swinging from the stars  
Now this wretch in beggars clothing  
Bangs his cup across the bars  
Look, this cup of mine is empty!  
Seems I've misplaced my desires  
Seems I'm sweeping up the ashes  
Of all my former fires  
So brother, be a brother  
fill this tiny cup of mine  
And please, sir, make it whiskey  
I have no head for wine  
  
O brother, my cup is empty......... (2 times)  
  
I counted up my blessings  
And counted only one  
One tiny little blessing  
And now that blessings gone  
So buy me one more drink, my brother  
Then I'm taking to the road  
Yes, I'm taking to the rain  
And I'm taking to the snow  
O my friend, my only brother  
Do not let the party grieve  
So throw a dollar onto the bar  
Now kiss my ass and leave  
  
O brother, my cup is empty......... (2 times)
