Intro: Ab   Gm   Ab   Gm  
  
        Ab                  Gm  
All the towers of ivory are crumbling  
        Ab                            Gm  
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks  
Ab      Bb  Eb                Ab  
This is the time of our great undoing  
            Eb                  Ab  
This is the time that I'll come running  
Ab       Gm   Fm  
Straight to you  
               Ab  
For I am captured  
Ab       Gm   Fm  
Straight to you  
               Ab  
For I am captured  
Bb       Eb      
One more time  
  
  
Eb   Ab   Eb   Ab   Ab-Gm-Fm   Ab   Bb  
  
  
    Ab                     Gm  
The light in our window is fading  
    Ab                    Gm  
The candle gutters on the ledge  
Ab    Bb  Eb              Ab  
Well now sorrow, it comes a-stealing  
         Eb                       Ab  
And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come a-running  
Ab       Gm   Fm  
Straight to you  
          Ab  
For I am captured  
Ab       Gm   Fm  
Straight to you  
              Ab  
For I am captured  
Bb       Eb     
Once again  
  
  
Eb   Ab   Eb    Ab        
  
                                
Ab           Bb      Gm    Ab  
Gone are the days of rainbows  
Ab           Bb        Gm                Ab  
Gone are the nights of swinging from the stars  
        Eb                       Ab  
For the sea will swallow up the mountains  
        Eb                               Ab  
And the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks  
Ab       Gm   Fm  
Straight at you  
                     Ab  
But I'll come a-running  
Ab       Gm   Fm  
Straight to you  
                     Ab  
But I'll come a-running  
Bb       Eb  
One more time  
  
  
Eb   Ab   Eb   Ab   Fm   Ab    Bb  
  
  
Ab                       Gm  
Heaven has denied us its kingdom  
Ab                     Gm           Ab  Bb  
The saints are drunk howling at the moon  
    Eb                     Ab  
The chariots of angels are colliding  
           Eb                       Ab  
Well, I'll run, babe, but I'll come running  
Ab       Gm   Fm  
Straight to you  
              Ab  
For I am captured  
Ab       Gm   Fm  
Straight to you  
               Ab  
For I am captured  
Bb       Eb  
One more time   
  
Eb    Ab    Eb   Ab
