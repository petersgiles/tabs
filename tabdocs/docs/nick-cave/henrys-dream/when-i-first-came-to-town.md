'Lord how quickly they changed...'
  
C  
When I first came to town  
All the people gathered round  
               F  
They bought me drinks  
                                     C  
Lord, how they quickly changed their tune  
  
C  
When I first came to town  
People took me round from end to end  
Like someone may take round a friend  
      F                          C  
O how quickly they changed their tune  
  
C  
Suspicion and dark murmurs surround me  
Everywhere I go they confound me  
As though the blood on my hands  
                   F           Dm   G  
Is there for every citizen to see  
  
F  
O sweet Jesus  
                    C  
There is no turning back  
         Gm              Eb  
There is always one more town  
         Cm               F  
A little further down the track  
  
And from my window, across the tracks  
I watch the juicers burn their fires  
And in that light  
Their faces leer at me  
How I wish they'd just let me be  
  
When I first came to town  
Their favours were for free  
Now even the doors of the whores of this town  
Are closed to me  
  
I search the mirror  
And I try to see  
Why the people of this town  
Have washed their hands of me  
  
O sweet Jesus  
There is no turning back  
There is always one more town  
A little further down the track  
  
O lord, every god-damn turn I take  
I fear the noose, I fear the stake  
For there is no bone  
They did not break  
In all the towns I've been before  
  
Well those that sin against me are snuffed out  
I know from every day that I live  
God-damn the day that I was born  
The night that forced me from the womb  
And god-damn this town  
For I am leaving now  
But one day I will return  
And the people of this town will surely see  
Just how quickly the tables turn  
  
O sweet Jesus  
This really is the end  
There is always one more town  
A little further round the end
